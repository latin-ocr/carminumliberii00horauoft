bendest to thy sway.‘

18. uvidus, ‘steeped in wine ἰ cf. 1. 7. 22 and 1. 18. 3.

19. nodo viperino, ‘ a knot of snakes.’· The Maenads in Euripides
(Bacchae ¹04 and 696) wear live snakes in their hair and about their
waists. For snakes in connexion with Bacchus cf. 1. 18. 11 n.

20. Bistonidum crin-is. The Bistonides are the women of the
tribe of Bistones, a Thracian people who were enthusiastic in the
worship of Bacchus. Cf. 1. 36. 14 and 11. 7. 27 sor allusions to
Thracian orgies.

sine fraude, ‘without hurt ' to the women. Cf. Carm. Saec- 41.
22. Gigantum. Cf. 11. 12. 7 and 9, and 111. 4. 49-63.

23. Rhoetum. The giant slain by Bacchus is elsewhere called
Eurytus, whereas Rhoetus was a Centaur who fought with the Lapithae
(Verg. Georg. 11. 456). Horace however names Rhoetus among the

leader‚ whether of the dance or the combat.

It is to be observed that, as wine makes some men quarrelsome,
others merry, the worship of Bacchus was introduced into Greece in two
forms, a savage and brutal form which came by way of Thrace, and
a mild and cheersul form which came from the South. Both forms
existed together in Attica. The logends concerning the god, similarly,
represent him now as kind aud beneficent‚ now as cruel and blood-
thirsty. The late Mr Pater, ariting on the Bacchae of Euripides, sa
“Dionysus Omophagus, the eater of raw flesh, must be added to e
golden image of Dionysus Meilichius, the honey-sweet,'' if we are to
form a clear idea of the place of the god in Greek religion. See also
L. Dyer’s The Gods in Greece, pp. 75-117.
