64 HORACE, ODES 11. xviii, xix.

The tale is not found in any ancient writer, and it is possible that
Horace learnt it from a book by Maecenas called ‘ Prometheus) The
same thought is present in Epist. 11. 2. 178 quid vici prosunt aut horrea?
quidve Calabris Saltibus adiecti Lucani, si metit Orcus Grandia cum
par-wls· non exorabilis auro ?

36. mc, i.e. Orcus.

37. Tantali genus, Pelops. (Cf. 11. ¹3· 37.) The family os
Tantalus furnished, to Greek tragediam, a favourite example of ὕβρις,
i.e. the insolence engendered by wealth and power. Hence superbum
Tantalum in 36, and coercet ‘ curbs,' ‘tames’: as in Sat. 1. 3. 134suste
coerces.

38. levare functum etc. For the complicated constr. ἀπὸ κοινοῦ
cf. Introd. p. xxv.

40· vocatus atque non vocatu& imitated from Greek, e.g. Thucyd-
1. 118 where Apollo promises to assist the Athenians καὶ παρακαλού-
μενος καί ἄκλητος. audit with non vocatus is an oxymoron, bringing
out the watchsulness of Orcus. ’

Ode ΧΙΧ.

Scheme. Ι have seen Bacchus teaching the nymphs and Satyrs
My heart still throbs with an excitemeut that is almost more than I oen
bear. The god inspires me and I can sing of his miracles, his exploits
in war, his power over the satellites of death.

The ode is, to some degree, imitated from a Greek dithyramb‚ a
hysterieal song in praise of Bacchus. (Cf. 111. 25 and the latter hals of
1. 18.) The details of the miracles performed by Bacchus seem to be ⁷
taken from the Bacchae of Euripides.

Metre. Alcaic.
1. remotis, ‘secluded,’ like separatis in l. 18.
rupibus, ‘ a gorge‚' valley shut in by precipitous cliffs.

2. vidi, ‘I have just seenss A picture of Bacchus teaching the
nymphs and satyrs has been found on au ancient vase.

medita posteri, cf. posteri negabitis in Epod. 9. 1 r.

4. capripedum, ‘goat-soot‘ (used by Tennyson). Roman poets
confused the Satyrs with the Pans and the Fauni, to whom the goat’s
feet properly belonged. Satyrs are represented in Greek art as of

hliliman slliape‚ though they have little horus, sharp-pointed ears and
s ort tal s.

“ acutas, ‘pricked—up,’ so that the points became conspicuous.

5. euhoe, in Greek εὐοῖ, the cry of the Bacchanals. Cf. 1. 18. 9.
Horace could not see the god without catching something of the
Bacchic frenzy.

6. pleno Bacchi pectore, abl. abs. Cf. 111. 25. 1 quo me, Bacche,
rapis tui Plenum? The same metaphor is seen in the Greek ἔνθεος
