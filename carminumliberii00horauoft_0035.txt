5. sse Alcmanian stanza is used in 1. 7 and 28, and in
Epode 12. lt consists os couplets made up of an ordinary
dactylic hexameter, followed by a dactylic tetrameter.

1,3· -ωΙ-ωΙ-,ῦυΙ-πΙ-υυῇ-Ξ.

2,4. -ῦῦΙ-ῦῦΙ-πΙ-Ξ.

ln the second line, there is usually a caesura in the second
or third dactyl.

Τῑιο rhythm is really dactylic, i.e. each dactyl is of the value

J ΑΡ] and each spondee osthe value ,¹ ,1.

6. The other metres used in the odes are exhibited only in
single specimens, which are treated in the notes as they sever-
ally occur (see 11. 18. 111. 12. w. 7). But the metre of 1. 4 may
be speciany noticed here.

It is called the Fourtlt A rcltilocln'an, and consists of a sour-
line stanza in which the lines are arranged as follows :

1, 3. -W— υυ-, w— υυ,-υ- υ--.

2, 4- υ - υ - U, -- -----

The first line ι5 called‘ the greater Archilochian': the second
is an ‘iambic trimeter catalectic'1

This combination is so curious that Dr Schmidt thinks that

Horace must have read the dactyls as J* ο Rs? not as
λοι Ρ. Ρ, 5ο that the rhythm becomes trochaic, thus:

‘flngJJJlJ'JJlJJ1J0JIJJIJAJ1
²24JIJ ,ΡΙ ,ΡΙᾸ,ΡΙ,Ι,ΡΙ,Ι.Ι,Ι·ι

¹ A ‘ oetalectic‚’ or ‘stopping’ line, is one which eomes to an end in
the middle os a foot.
