Ode ΧΧ.

‘reum

Sckaoe. 1 shall soar away on majestie pinions, Maecenas. Humble
1 m. 1 :lun not die. 1 feel mysels changing into a bird and 1 shall
to the uttermost parts of the earth, that all peoples may know me.
&hen 1 nm gone. let there be no idle tears or dirges or tomb for me.
The ode is an epilogue to the Second Book, expressing, by an
allegor-y, the poet’s conviction that his writings had won him immor-
tality. He will disappoer, he says. but he will not die.

Mm- Aloeic.

ι. mm ‘not usual? bemuse Horace was princeps Aeolium
men ad Italos Baius-isse modos (111. 30. 13, ¹4)-

τ. ΜΒ vatos, ‘a hard transsormed.’ Horace like Pindar
(cf. lv. a. 25) is a man who, by poesy, mn become a swan. He will
not die: he will assume his swan-form and soar away into the heavens.
The metaphor‚ by which a poet is called a swan or an eagle or any
other kind of bird, is treated as a matter of fact and becomes an

nllegory: just as in 1. 14 the metaphor of ‘ the ship of state ¹ is treated
as matter of fact.

4. innan maior, ‘ triumphant over envy.'

5. pauperum sanguin parentum. This explains invidia maior.
In Sat. 1. 6. 46 Horace speaks of himself as one quem rodunt omnes
Bkrtino patre natum Nunc quia sim tibi, Maecenas, convictor, at
oliuu Quod mihi pareret legio Romana tribuno. The envious carped at
Horace bemuse. though of most ignoble birth, he was admitted to the
imnost circle of Maecenas’ friends.

'6. qum vocas, ‘who (they say) am at your beck and eall! The
envious twit Horace with his mean birth, and also with his frequent
invitations to Maecenas’s table, as if he were a mere parasite. For voco
in this sense cf. 111. 6. 30, and see Lewis and Short‚ voco B. 1. and
math. The favourite explanation of this passage takes dilecte with
vocas: ιΙ, whom you mu dilecte! But this, even if it were Latin,
would not be good sense. Some term of reproach‚ similar to pauperum
,εἴιμ’-τ parentum, is absolutely required, to account sor the repetition

non qv.

H. T. mass, an ingenious Swiss scholar, has a theory that Horace
imagines his body to be lying dead and Maecenas to be calling him for
the lm time, as was usual at Roman funerals. But this explanation is

ffitzythethesavmgrffsbjggogibg's the lant and is also effectually contra-

7. dnum. There is a special point in the epithet‚ as showing
both that the charge of parasitimn was a calumny and that Horace
could endure it out of his love for Maecenas.

9. un ian. Horace feels the metamorphosis beginning.
mum ‘'ssle skin is shrinking into rough scales on my legs.‘
