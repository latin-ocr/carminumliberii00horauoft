‘nne ida that the odeis playful, not pathetic. is developed in the
notes αι 11. 7.21 and 2311'1s obsemble that a similar ode os Catullus
(ιι, beginning Fm· α Aureli, cannes Catulli) is certainly comic.

h-o. Some edd. take this seriously, as if Horace were ill and
and looked forward to an early doeth. But there are good
rums for thinking that the poem is merely playsul, intended to mock
the extr-angant schem-s of Septimius. Put shortly, the argument is as
fisslows: ‘Septimius you would follow me to Gades or the Cantabri or
Syrtes· but the journey to Tibur (a few miles) is quite enough of
travelling and mmpaigning sor me, for Ι am siek of them. ' It is to be
remembered that Horace was, at the time when this ode was published,
only 4ι (see Introd. p. xvii) and still far from senecta. The only data
when he was really ywoery of travelling and fighting were in 13..c41
aster Phili ppiand perhaps ιιι Β. c. 31 after Actium (lntrod. p. xiii). Is
the ode had been written at either date, the allusion to senecta and
approaching death would have been utterly absurd- But (like all the
other odes) it was probably not written till B.C. 29 or later, when the
Cantabri were in rebellion. Septimius, who wanted to see some
military service (Epist. 1. 9), had very likely asked Horace to join the
expedition into Spain and to take him as a eompanion.
