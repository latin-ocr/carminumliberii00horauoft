(b) similarly, a verb, which belongs to both parts of a
eompound sentence, is often inserted in the second part with
aque or -vez eg- 1. 30. &Gratias properentque nymphae: u. 7.

sumitur-me myrto. Also 11. 17. 16:19. 28, 31: 111. 412:
Cam. Sacc. 22.

(c) Sentences in which a word may be constructed with
either os two other words—the so-called construction ain-‹⁸› κοινοῦ
or ‘in common ’-are frequent. A striking instance is in 11. 18.
37 hic levaresunctum Ι pauperem laboribus Ι vocatus atquc non
vocatus audit. Here laboribus is appropriate to levare and to
sunctum: and levare is appropriate to vocatus and to audit.
So in 11. 11. 11 consilia& may be constructed with minorem and
fatigas: and in 111. 8, 19 sibi with infestus or dissidet.

On the whole, one is glad to find that Quintilian, the

Α Mein, in Latin and Greek, is the arrangement os long and
short syllables in a line of poetry.

Rhytlana is the arrangement of stresses (ictus) or loud
syllables. In other words, mette is the mode of constructing
- aliae: rhythmis the mode of reading or singing it ¹.

For purposes of metre, all long syllables are alike, and all
short syllables are alike: but sor purposoe os rhythm (as in

music) long syllables may be of different lengths, and short
syllables may be of different lengths.

² In English metre and rhythm are identioeL for with ns a syllable
which has stress is long, and a syllable which has no stroes is short.
