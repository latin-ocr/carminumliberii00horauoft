οἱ the instantes in Horace (eg. certat tollere in 1. ι. 6, or
gnudetpomzm 1. 3⁴- 16, or tendentes imposuisse ιιι 4. 52) can
be paralleled in prose, but the following are extremely bold:
pam egit vitm (1. 2. 8), contitrata rumpere and suri! reperire
(1. 15. 7 and 27), te persequor frangere (1. 2 3. ιο), tradam ventis
porion (ι. 26. 3), laborat trepidare (11. 3. ιι), urges summovere
(ιι. 18. 21), ᾰεαϊί spernere (11. 16. 39), impulerit maturare necem
(ιιι. 7. 14-16), me expetit urere (Epod. ιι. 5).

The infinin've is similarly used with adjectiva to suggest a
purpose οι· consequence, or to limit the aspect of the epithet¹:
as indocilis pati (ι. ι. 18), callidus condere (1. 10. 7), blandus
ficere 1. 12. ιι, 12),praesens tollere and dolosus serre (1. 35. 2
and 28), leviora tolli (ιι. 4. ιι), pertinax ludere (ιιι. 29, 53),
'efficax eluere (w. 12. 2ο), veraces cecinisse (Carm. Sacc. 25),
lubra-us aspin· (1. 19. 8), niveus videri (lv. 2. 59), nefas videre
(Epod. 16. 14), nobilis superare (1. 12. 26), and dolens vinci (lv,

lt is obvious that, in many os these instances, a gerund with or
without a preposition might have been used. Horace, however,
regards the infinitive (in the Greek way) as an indeclinable noun.

'1'th consu-actions, though found in other Latin poets, are
speciany characteristic of Horace; but, besides these, he has
many other and more common devicoe to procure that per-
petual quaintness which, as Aristotle said, is essential to
poetical diction.

3. With adjectiva, he is partial to a kind os hspallage

¹ The Greek constructions imitated are such as ἀνὴρ χαλεπὸς συζῇ,
παρέχω ἐμαυτὸν ‘rip‘ ἱατρᾴῐ τέμνειν, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι, λευκὸς ὁρᾶσθαι.

² In the instances above cited, grammarians would call some of the
infinitiva prolate or complementum others epexegetical or aphnatoty.
The differenoe between the two kinds is briefly this: the prolate infin.
is neceaenry to limit the meaning of the preceding verb or adjective,
while the epexegetical infin. is merely illustrative of the meaning. Eg.
celer irasci mans ‘quick to anger‚’ not ‘qnick at everything anger
included: whereas blandus ducere quercus does menn ‘ persuasive to
eveything, oaks included)
