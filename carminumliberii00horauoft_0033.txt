INTRODUCTION. xxix

This rhythm is trochaic, with an anamu‘s (or ‘striking-up'
syllable) at the beginning of lines 1, 2, 3.
2. The &milne stanza is used in 25 odes, via:

1. 2. 10. 12. 20. 22. 25. 3⁰- 32. 38.
11. 2. 4. 6. 8. xo. 16.

ιη. 8. 11. 14. 18. 20. 22. 27.

lv. 2. 6. 1 ι and Carmen Saeculare.

Tbe. stanza seems to have been invented by Alcaeus, though
it is named aster Sappho. The metrical scheme is:

1, 2, 3- -υ, - - -, υυυυυ v (eleven syllables).
4. - υ υ - v (five syllables).

The longer line is called tlte lesser Sapphic: the shorter the
Adonim.

ln the longer line Horace always has the fourth syllable
long, whereas Sappho (and Catullus) often had it short.

Horace has also introduced a caesura, which was not used
by Sappho. This caesura, in the first three Books, generally
occurs after the 5th syllable, and only occasionally aster the 6th
(e-g. 1. ιο. 1, 6, 18), but in the fourth Book and Carm. Sacc. it is
very frequently placed after the 6th syllable (in fact, 39 times in
only sour compositions).

Synapheia is obviously respected between the 2nd and 3rd
lines in 11. 2. 18: 16. 34: lv. 2. ²²3 where final syllables are
elided: and between the 3rd and 4th lines in 1. 2. 19: 25. 11:
11. 16. 7: 1v. 2. 23; Carm. Sacc. 47, where either a word is
divided (as in the first three passages) or a syllable elided (as in
the last two).

Yet hiatus between the lines frequently occurs, as in ῐ. 2. 41
and 47: 12. 6 and 7 etc.

'Ibe original rhythm‚ according to Dr Schmidt, was trochaic
and may be represented thus :
