INTRODUCTION. xxi

⁷ hia poetns are not, to use Wordsworth’s phrase, ‘the sponta-

neous overssow of power-ful feeling! He himself describes them
as laborious (operosa carmina C. tv. 2. 3¹)· But they are sincere,
that is to say, they axe the genuine expression os his thoughts and
sentimentsg and is they do not reveal to us a man os prosound
insignit or ardent passions or lofty imagination, they show at
last sympathy‚ affection, humour, a generous admiration os
great men and noble deeds‚ and a sturdy pride in his vooetion.
And a man with these qualities, is his vocation happens to be
literature, has always been sure os a lasting success. The tact
which results from his sympathy and humour appears in his
style as well as in ,his matter, and his writings have the charrn
which is recognized as ‘companionable.’ In our own country,
Addison and Lamb, in France, Montaigne and Mme. de
sev-igne, are conspicuous examples of the Horatian tempera-
ment and of its enduring popularity. And Horace had the
advantage os writing in verse and os using a language which
gave the utmost assistance to his special literary talent. ‘The
bat words in the best places' is a definition of poetry that
Coleridge was fond of repeating. It might serve sor a descrip-
tion of Horace’s writing. He was gifted by nature with a fine
ω and an infinite capacity for taking pains, and he had had
a scholarly education. He borrowed, from Greek, metres of
peculiar swing, and he had, in his native Latin, a store os
sonorons and pregnant words, a terse and lucid grammar, and
the liberty to arrange his words to the best advantage. With
these mounes, he has produced an incomparable series of
brilliant phrases (‘jewels five words long' Tennyson calls them)
which are at once oesy to remember and impossible to translate ¹.

² It is idle to quote instances where almost every line is an instance.
bnt one might choose simplex munditiis or insaniens sapientia or
splendide mendax as examploe of Horace’s nntranslatoeble brevity:
dulce d decorum at pro patria mori or nihil est ab omni parde beatum as
example· os finished commonplace: non indecoro pulvere sordidos or
manium fulget honoribus or impavidum ser-ient ruinae as specimens
of mority, and qui fragilem truci commisit pelago ratem z an instance
of the ansul arrangement of contrasted words.
