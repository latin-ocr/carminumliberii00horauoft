58 HORACE, ODES 11. xvi, xvii.

31. et mihi forsan etc. The contrast between Achilles and
Tithonus has suggested the further thought that one man’s lot has
advantages that another's misses. ‘ Time, as it flies, will perhaps offer
to me something that it has refused to you) just as it has given to you
things that it has not given to me.

32. hora, ‘the moment‚‘ i.e. any moment, the smallest period of
time marked by noticeable change. Cf. puncto mobilis horae in Epist.
11. 2. 172.

33. Siculae. The epithet belongs to the flocks as well as the
herds‚ sor the estates of Grosphus lay in Sicily. (See above the note on
the Dedication.)

34. mugiunt, used by zeugma of greges, but proper only to vaccae.
hinnitum. For the elision cf. 1v. 2. 22 and Introd. p. xxix.

35. equa. Mares were preferred for racing: cf. Verg. Georg. 1.
59 (mittit) Eliadum palmas Epiros equarum.

Afro murice. Cf. Epist. 11. 2. 181 vestes Gaetulo murice tinctae.
This African purple is said to have been produced from shell-fish
obtained on the shores of the island Meninx, or Girba, near the Laeser
Syrtis.

bis tinctae. All purples seem to have been twice dyed, δίβαφα,
first, according to Pliny (lx. 135, 136), with the pelagium, then with
the bucinum. Cf. Epod. 12. 21 muricibus JJvriis iteratae vellera lanae.
It is not clear what purple raiment Horace is alluding to. Grosphus is
not likely to have worn a purple toga (but see 11. 18. 8 n.), but he may
have worn a toga praetexta either as a former curule magistrate or as
holding some provincial office.

38. spiritum, ‘the dainty melody of the Greek muse-⁹ spiratus is
a translation of the Greek πνοή in the sense ‘music of the flute’: cf.
quod spiro et placeo in 1v. 3. 24. This quotation seems conclusive
against Orelli's view that spiritus is a translation of πνεῦμα, in the sense
of afflatus, ‘ inspiration.’ For tenuis cf. Cicero's oratio teres et tenuis.

camenae is a Latin name for the Muse, but Horace uses it of the
Greek muses again in 1v. 9. 8. The strange expression Calabrae
Pierides in 1v. 8. 2ο is probably not genuine.

39. Parca non mendax. Cf. vosque veraces cecinisse Parcae
(Carm. Saec. 25). The idea apparently is that Fate had promised
Horace poverty and poesy, and had kept her promise.

malignum, perhaps ‘ spiteful,’ but malignus elsewhere (1. 28. 23
and cf. benig-nus in 1. 9. 6 and 17. 15) means ‘ niggardly.’ The extreme
prominence given to malignum spernere vulgus suggests that Grosphus
had some cause of complaint against the populace, either in Rome or in
Sicily.
