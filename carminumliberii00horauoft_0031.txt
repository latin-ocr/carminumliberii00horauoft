other places, synapheia is ignored and hiatus permitted. Hiatus,
of course, implies a slight pause, while synapheia implies that
there was no pause between two lines.

F or reasons such as these, it is impossible to put sorward

· an authoritative scansion to Horace’s lines. In the metrical

schema here subjoined no soension will be suggested, but the
original (Le- the Greek) rhythm will be given in musical nota-
tion according to the theon‘es of Dr J. H. H. Schmidt ¹. lt will
be seen that Dr Schmidt divides a line into bars os equal
length, Le. occupying the same time in delivery.

In the metrical schmes, a comma marks the caesura or
mesas, iae. tke' point which must coincide with the end os a
vord'.

lt remains to be added that all the odes os Horace seem to
be divisible into stanzas of four lines. The only exceptions are
Ν. 8, which there are many reasons sor rejecting in whole or in
part: and 111. 12, which cons-ists of four periods of ten feet each.
The metres were undoubtedly borrowed by Horace from the
Greek lyrists, especially Alcaeus, but he has introduced many
small alterations, such as the use of long syllables where the
Greeks allowed shorts, and the regular use of caesura where the
Greeks had none.

² Technioelly, caesura is the division of a foot between two words,
so that part os the foot belongs to one word, the remainder to another.
Da‘aaeesr’a on the other hand, is the division of feet from one another so
that one foot ends with a word, while the next begins a new word.
