§7- The Text.

Horace’s works, as he himself prophesied (Epist. 1. 2ο. 17,
18), soon became one of the regular Roman schoolbooks. They
were so in the time os Quintilian and Juvenal (say ΑΛ). 100), and
remained so in the time of Ausonius (say ΑΛ). 380). Vergil, too,
shared the same'fate (see Mayor’s note on Juvenal vu. 2²7)-
But while of Vergil we have several MSS. complete or fragmen-
tary‚ which date from a very high antiquity (earlier than ΑΛ).
500), we have only one of Horace which is as old as the 9th
century. Most of the extant MSS. of Horace were written in
the roth century or later.

Moreover, no extant MS. of Horace seems to have been
written in Italy. The oldest, called B (Bernems, os the 9th
century), is a fragmentary copy written in Ireland. The others
appear to have been all written in france or Germany after that
revival of schools and of litei-ary studies which Charlemagne
introduced with the assistance of Alcuin of York (about ΑΛ).
820). There is evidence that Horace was well known to some
students at this time, though many years must have elapsed
“nesure the reading of profane poets was permitted in the
cathedral schools of the German Empire. At Paderbom, for
instance, it was not till after ΑΛ). 1000 that it could be said
‘viguit Horatius, magnus et Virguius, Crispus ac Salustius et
Urbanus Statius! (See Maitland’s Dark Ages, Nos. xl. and
vm. and class. Review 1894, p. 305.)

Of the extant MSS„ other than B, the chief are Αφψλπ, all
now at Paris: ὃ and d, both in the British Museum: R, now in
the Vatimn (though it was written in Alsace): l at Leyden: a
at Milan: ν at Dessau. All these, with some others, are

assigned to the 10th century, and there are many more os later
date.
