Ode w.

To Xanthias, a Phodan, described in some MSS. as an istralzsptes
or ‘salve-doctor! It is impossible to say whether the name is a
pseudonym or belonged to a real person os Horace’s or some earlier

Schema Be not ashamed, Xanthias, os loving a slave-girl. Achilles,
Ajax and Agamemnon set you the example. Perhaps she is of noble
birth. Her behaviour shows that she does not come from the lowest
classes.. Any way, she is pretty: though you noed not be joelous of me

2. mulin. Phoceu. The Latin adj. from Phocis is either Phocensis
οῐ Phocius or Phoce'us or Phocaicas. The Greek form Phoceus (dis-
syllable) does not seem to occur elsewhere in Latin. It is odd, too,
that the man should be addressad by a title derived from his place of
birth, though Horace osten uses such titles in speaking of a third
person ι e.g. Opuntiae frater Megyllae in 1. ²7· ιο. Ritter suggests that
the frater os that passage is perhaps identical with the Xanthias of this,
but if so, Xanthi-‘is should be a Locrian, not a Phoeian.
