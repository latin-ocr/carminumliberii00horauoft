Ode XV.

Scheme. The princely dwellings and pleasure—gardens and fishponds
of our time leave scarce space enough sor homely crops of corn and
olives and grapes. Our ancestors would not have permitted this.
Their rule was thrist in private life, magnifieenee in the service os the
state.

The ode is regarded by Kiessling as a fragment which Horace
originally intended to use somewhere in the grand series 111. 1-6, but
for which he did not there find a suitable place. Similar complaints of
the excessive luxury of the times are found in Sallust (Catiline 12, 13)
and in a letter of Tiberius to the senate quoted by Tacitus (Ann- 111.
53). The ode was probably written in B.C. 28, when Augustus, as
consul with censoria potestas, purged the senate, and attempted other
social retorms and restored 82 dilapidated temples in Rome.

1. iam, ‘ presently' as in 11. 5. 13.
