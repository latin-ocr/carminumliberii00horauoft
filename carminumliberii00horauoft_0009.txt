PREFACE.

HIS edition of Horace’s Odes and Epodoe was under-
taken at the requoet of the Syndics of the Pitt Press.

Iu the text, at a few notorious passages, 1 have admitted

conjectures which give a good sense with very little altera-

tion of the letters. The spelling is, for obvious reasons,

adapted in the main to that of Lewis and Short’s lexicon.
In regard to final -es and -is in acc. plur. of the 3rd declen·
sion 1 have almost always followed the indications given in
Keller’s Epilegomena.

In preparing the notes, 1 have used Orelli’s edition (as
revised in 1885 by Hixsehselder) freely for illustrative quo-
tations. It is the common quan-y. Boeidoe this, I have
referred very often to the editions of A. Kiessling (1884)
and Dean Wickham (1874), less frequently to those of
Mr Page (1886), C. W. Nauck (1880) and H. Schiitz (1874).
The dates given are the dates of my copies.

1 am greatly indebted to my friend Dr Postgate, of
Trinity College, for many corrections and suggestions.
