him in the later publications save an affectionate record of his
birthday in Cam. lv. 11. lt is known, from Tacitus (Ann-
ιιι. 30), that after Rc. 20 there was a coolness between
Maecenas and Augustus1. It is clear, too, from Suetonius,
that Augustus made efforts to detach Horace from Maecenas,
first by ofl'ering him a secretaryship, which was declined, and
afterwards by encouraging him to familiarity and giving him
handsome presents². One may imagine, therefore, that Horace
was in an awkward and unhappy position. He was not easy
with Augustus but dared not offend him, and perhaps his
compliance withthe emperor's commands roused some jealousy
in Maecenas. But the estrangement, if there was one, between
the poet and his patron did not endure. On his deathbed,
Maecenas wrote to Augustus ‘Horati flacci, ut mei, memor
esto! He died early in Rc. 8, and Horace followed him to the

was still shown in Suetonius’ time. This is supposed to have been
presented to him by Augustus.
