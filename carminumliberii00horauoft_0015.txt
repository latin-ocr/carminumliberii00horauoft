During his stay at Athens, Horace made the acquaintance
os many young Romans of noble birth¹‚ by whom apparently he
was introduced, in September nc. 44, to Μ. Junius Brutus⁸‚
the uben-ator. Brutus, at this time, was passing through
Athens on his way to the province os Macedonia which had
been assigned to him (as propraetor) by Julius Caesar before
his murder. (Cassius meanwhile was proceeding to his province,
Syria.) As governor of Macedonia, Brutus was collecting an
army, partly to oppose C. Antonius, who claimed the province
as nominee os the senate, and partly to combat some turbulent
tribes os Thraciam, who were harassing the borders. In this
army, Horace received the appointment os military tribune⁴.
ne max-ebed with the troops through Macedonia and Thrace,
erossed the Hellespont, saw a good deal of Asia Μίιιοτ6 and
returned with the combined forces of Brutus and Cassius to the
field of Philippi (N ov. Rc. 42). In the first battle at this place,
Brutus was victorious; in the second (twenty days later) he
was defeated, and Horace ssed‘, never to bear arms again.
