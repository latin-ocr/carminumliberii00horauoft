name of Acron were evidently put together by a writer who lived
some time after the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity.
The-e scholia are not of much assistance in the attempt to
restore the words of Horace himself. Often they do not com-
ment on the words in dispute and, when they do, Porphyrion
often supports one reading, Acron the other. Sometimes, too,
one reading is quoted as a heading to a note while the note
itself explains the other. No editor has at present found the
due to all this tangle. Messrs Keller and Holder, who have
examined far more MSS. than anybody else, have divided them
into three elaeses, but the grounds on which they base this
division are most unsatisfactory.

The chief editions of the text of Horace during the last 350

η years are those of M. A. Muretus (Venice, 1551), D. Lambinus

(Lyons, 1 561), J. Cruquius (Antwerp, 1578), D. Heinsius (heyden,
1605), T. Faber (Saumur, 1671), R. Bentley (Cambridge, 1711),
C. Fen (Rome, 1811), F. Pottier (Paris, 1823), A. Meineke
(Berlin, 1834), P. H. Peerlkamp (Haarlem, 1834), J. C. Orelli
(latich, 1837), W. Dillenburger (Bonn, 1844), F. Ritter (Leipzig,
1856), Κ. Lehrs (Leipzig, 1859), H. A. J. Munro (Cambridge,
1869), 0. Keller and A. Holder (ed. major, Leipzig, 1864-1870
and ed. minor, Leipzig, 1879). Among these, the edition of
J. Cruquius is especially noteworthy because it is founded
mainly on some MSS. (Blandinii) which formerly existed at
Blankenberghe‚ near Bruges, but which were bumt in 1568
soon after Cruquius collated them. One of them, which editors
can V (vetustissimus), was a very good MS., but not specially
good in the odes. Fen used the MSS. now in Italy: Orelli
, those in Switzerland: Pottier those in Paris. Other editors have
chosen MSS. in different libr-aries. Keller and Holder have

inspected about 50 MSS. and have carefully collated about 2 5 in
various comm-ies.

The chief commentaries on Horace, at least in regard to the
collection of illustrative matter, are those of Orelli and Dillen-

burget.
