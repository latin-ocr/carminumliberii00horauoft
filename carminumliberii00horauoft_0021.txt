world. (2) No ode in the first three Books poihts clearly to a
later date than Rc. 24. On the other hand, there are odes in
all three Books which teser to this and earlier dates. Thus
111. 14 relata to the return of Augustus from Spain: ι. 24 to
the death of Quintilius: and 1. 29 to the expedition of Aelius
Gallus into Arabia„ All these events happened in B-C. 24.
11. 4 was written near the end of Horace’s sortieth year, i.e.
ac. 25. 1. 31, 11. ις and m. 6 seem all to refer to the restora-
tion os temples which occupied Augustus in Rc. 28. lt is
obvious that these odes could have been published together.
(3) The first Book <annot have been published before Rc. 24,
sor it refers, as v've have just seen, to events os that year. Is
the second and third Books were written (in part) and published
later, why does Horace, about Rc. 20 (see Epist. 1. 1. 1-10),
spoek as is he had long given up the practice of writing lyrics
and could not resume it?

15, then, we assume that the first three Books were published
together, they must have been published late in Rc. 24 or early
in Rc. 23. This date is inserted from the fact that Marcellus,
the nephew and adopted son of Augustus, is referred to as the
hope of the Caesarian house in Carm. 1. 12. 45—483 and Lici-
nius Murena, brother-in·law of Maecenas, is addressed in carm.
11. ιο and referred to as living in 111. 19. Marcellus died in the
autumn of Rc. 23, and Murena was executed sor conspiracy in
nc. 22. It is not likely that Horace published these references
to them after their death&

The only other dates proposed are Rc. 19 and Rc. 22. The
former date is suggested because 1. 3 is supposed to refer to
the voyage which Vergil took, to Greece, early m Rc. 19, and
other odes, especially 11. 9, are thought to refer to the expedi-
tion into Armenia os Rc. 20. The date of 11. 9, however, seems
to be fixed to the end of B.c. 25, or the beginning of 24, by
the allusion to tropaea Augusti Caesaris, a grand monument
so called, voted by the Senate in Rc. 25. (See the concluding
note on ιι. 9.) As to 1. 3, it is likely that this ode does not
refer to Vergil's last voyage to Greece, sor it says nothing about
Vergil’s ill-hoelth.
