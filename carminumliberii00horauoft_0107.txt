ίιο. The ‘limit’ of Orcus is a bonndary, but also a stoppagq

Q& is probably abl. agreeing with fine, though finis is usually
mse. in Homoe (fem. only in Epod. ¹7· 36). Bentley took it ις nom.
agreeing with aula, but it is unlikely that Horace permitted a short
vowel to precede aula in the next line.

Orelli. Wiekham and Kicssling take destinata as abl. agreeing with
aula understood. Wickham translates: ‘And yet no mansion more
cuttinly awaits the woelthy master than that one traced out for him by
the linit of Orcus greedy as himself' ε but it is highly improbable that
Home placed datium between fine and aula without intending it to
ngree with either. Nauck and Page take fine destinam together (‘ the

intcd end’), with a slight improvement to the sense. The general
'ons to this sense have been stated above³ but it should be said
that Servius (see critica note) obviously understood the passage in this
way.
