⁴ Sappho or Anacreon wrote—songs intended to be sung by one

person in a private circle ¹.

The lyrioe os Horace (though they were meant to be md or
iecited, not sung) belong entirely in form, and usually in
substance, to the latter class. His metros are all bon-owed
from the Greek song-writers, and his Muse, as he often says,

‚ was inclined to be sportive (iocosa) rather than solemn& Even

in the cao-mm Saeculare and in carna. lv. 6, which were
written sor public performance by a chorus, he did not attempt
the grand Pindaric elaboration which, he confess& indeed
(Cam. lv. 2. 257—32), was beyond him. Yet several os the
longer and graver odes (see especially 111. 3, 4, 5, 11, 27, xv. 4),
though still written in song-metres, are quite Pindaric in the
treatment os the theme. In 111. 3, for instance, the opening

ζ ⁸ The extant odes of Pindar are all ‘epinikia‚' i-e. celebrations of

the victor-ies of certain persons in the groet athletic contests of Greeoe.

The following summary of the First Olympian Ode will sufficiently
show Pindar's manner of treating a theme:

1—15. water is the best drink: gold the ehoieoet metal: so are
the olympie games the noblest gamos

15—38. Let us sing the praisae of Hiero, the victor, who won
glory at Olympia„ the home of Pelops.

38—55. Song mn give currency to falsehoods but we must not
spe-k evil of deitiae.

562—85. Poseidon, of his great love, oesried off Pelops. The tale
tint Pelops was killed and eaten is a base invention.
